          <h2>Cigarette Smoking and Tobacco Use Among People of Low Socioeconomic Status</h2>
          <p>Adults who have lower levels of educational attainment, who are unemployed, or who live at, near, or below
            the U.S.
            federal poverty level are considered to have low socioeconomic status (SES). In the U.S., people living
            below the
            poverty level and people having lower levels of educational attainment have higher rates of cigarette
            smoking
            than the general population.</p>
          <h3>People with low SES tend to smoke cigarettes more heavily.</h3>
          <p>People living in poverty smoke cigarettes for a duration of nearly twice as many years as people with a 
            family income of three times the poverty rate. People with a high school education smoke cigarettes for a 
            duration of more than twice as many years as people with at least a bachelorâ€™s degree. Blue-collar workers 
            are more likely to start smoking cigarettes at a younger age and to smoke more heavily than white-collar workers.
